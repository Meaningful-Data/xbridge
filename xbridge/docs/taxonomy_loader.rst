Taxonomy loader
***************

A classification system used by XBRL. It defines the specific tags for individual items of data.
It is the main file to work with, and it is form by the modules, which are the objects where information is contain.
When compressed files (ZIP or 7z) are loaded, modules are called and saved in a JSON file. This is important because it is the main source
for the rest of information contained in this JSON, such as the taxonomy it belongs or the tables and variables it contains.

When modules are loaded, the access to the tables that are form with, are available by just calling them from the JSON created before.
Each of these tables contains open keys and variables, which are the basic information of the taxonomy. Moreover, its attributes can be extracted.

Finally, Variables are generated by combining the open keys column with the attributes found within the taxonomy modules.
variables contains two main aspects: dimensions and attributes. This dimensions may contain units, like base currency,
and concepts, and attributes will indicate the valid decimals (precision).
