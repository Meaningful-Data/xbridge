- When requested to prepare a release candidate, you have to follow these steps:
    - Make sure that we are not working in main.
    - Check PyPI to verify what versions have already been published at https://pypi.org/project/eba-xbridge/#history
    - Determine the next appropriate release candidate number based on PyPI history
    - Update the version in pyproject.toml and src/xbridge/__init__.py
    - Update documentation
    - Run the following commands and fix any reported issue. After fixes, ask for review of material changes, if any.
        - `ruff check --fix`
        - `ruff format`
        - `mypy`
    - Ensure all tests pass.
    - Create a commit message and release notes, following best practices.
    - But please don't commit, I want to review everything
